Email: ziad.ismaili-alaoui@liverpool.ac.uk (~~z.ismaili-alaoui@york.ac.uk~~)

I used to have my email address reversed to reduce the risks of spam from web scrapers, but I decided to be less annoying.

I am (albeit rarely) occasionally active on [[Codeforces]](https://codeforces.com/profile/Turkmeniscoldish) and [[CS Stack Exchange]](https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/157952/ziad-ismaili-alaoui).
