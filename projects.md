## Random Projects

- [[GP 2 (contributor)]](https://github.com/UoYCS-plasma/GP2/) GP 2 is a visual, rule-based graph programming language; designed by Detlef Plump, and initially implemented by Christopher Bak, and later Jack Romo, Graham Campbell and myself. In a nutshell, it works by algorithmically transforming an input graph into an output graph by sequentially applying graph transformation rules defined by the programmer (given in the form of a GP 2 program). I had been a contributor to the compiler while I pursued my Master's degree at the University of York, and helped redesign and reprogram certain aspects of the compiler to enable more optimised implementations of classical graph algorithms. To give an example, the time complexity of the best-known implementation of a graph depth-first search in GP 2 was quadratic in the size of the input graph; however, the changes brought to the data structures generated by the compiler allowed for much better implementations of the algorithm, to then run in time linear to the size of the input graph! If interested, see [my journal publication with Detlef Plump](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09144) for a broad summary of the changes, with a few case studies (e.g. 2-colouring, acyclicity verification, or computing shortest paths).
  
- [[The Weasal Program]](https://github.com/ismaili-ziad/blind-watchmaker-algorithm) A proposed C++ implementation of natural selection as per Richard Dawkins in *The Blind Watchmaker*. In his famous book, he explains a simple yet powerful algorithmic way to illustrate that natural process. The goal is to start with a string of random characters and mutate it until a target sentence is reached. A graphical interface for the program is available [here](https://github.com/ismaili-ziad/the-weasel-program-GUI).
  
- [[The Mollab Project]](https://github.com/ismaili-ziad/Mollab-Project) A tentative high-school project where a user inputs the structure of a molecule and the program automatically computes its nomenclature (i.e. name). Unfortunately, the range of molecules it can support is pretty narrow.
  
- [[Manaloo.com (discontinued)]](https://web.archive.org/web/20220117234233/https://manaloo.com/) A little recreational website consisting of a series of mathematical problems meant to be solved with a single expression/formula (probably my most exciting (ex-)project). It is relatively close to *Project Euler*, but instead of expecting a simple integer as an answer, the website expects a function instead (i.e. a variable expression) that it then evaluates against the expected expression. The site was sadly discontinued in 2022/23 due to high hosting fees and its small size, but it had 30+ registered members from all over the world!
